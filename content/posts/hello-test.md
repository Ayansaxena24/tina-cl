# Introduction to AI

Artificial intelligence is transforming how we work and live. This post explores the fundamentals of AI and its applications in various industries.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

### Types of AI

AI can be categorized in multiple ways, but one common distinction is between narrow (or weak) AI and general (or strong) AI.
